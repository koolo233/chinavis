										<p>The ChinaVis 2021 Arts Program, or China VISAP'21, showcases innovative artwork and research that explores the exciting and increasingly prominent intersections between art, design, and visualization. It runs from July 24 to 27 during the ChinaVis 2021 conference in Wuhan, China. The goal of the program is to foster new thinking, discussion, and collaboration between artists, designers, technologists, visualization scientists, and others working at the intersection of these fields.</p>

                                                <h3>Theme</h3>
                                        </header>
                                        <p>
                                                The theme for the China VISAP'21 is "Bridge". We invite visualization works that investigate the meaning of bridge in a broader spectrum.
                                        </p>
										<p>
												A bridge is a structure that overcomes obstacles and provides passage, connection, contact, or transition. It can also be a link between time, space and culture. It not only carries the physical load but also communicates and connects. The ingenious Zhaozhou Bridge (constructed in 595 AD) in China is a symbol of wisdom, and the Magpie Bridge for lovers reflects people's poetic imagination. A bridge is an invitation to connect, in addition, a representation of overcoming adversity and building unity. In the information age, visualization is the bridge connecting data with human cognition, promoting understanding and empathy in society, and aiding the globe to arrive at a new consensus of a shared future.
										</p>
										<p>
												The 2021 China Visualization and Visual Analysis Conference will be held in Wuhan, where the longest river in Asia Yangtze River passes through. Regarded as the First Bridge of the Yangtze, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge (1955) is an architectural wonder and Wuhan’s most famous landmark. Therefore, VISAP'21 chose "Bridge" as this year’s theme of artistic creations. We encourage all participants to develop artworks around the concept of bridge, exploring topics related to connections between humans and nature, individuals and society, physical space and virtual experience, as well as the functionalities of bridges in emotional space and culture domains.
										</p>
										<p>
												The pandemic has caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown. The challenge is dire of recovering from both economic and cultural disruptions. Nonetheless, we are presented with an unprecedented opportunity to reconnect the disjointed, if not fragmented, the world we live in and move forward with the lessons learned from the difficult time and hardship.
										</p>
										<p>
												China VISAP'21 invites artists, designers, and researchers to explore data visualization ideas for sustainable development that may heal and strengthen human connections, communication, and cognition as a major task facing the global community. As Priya Clemens, Director of Public Affairs for the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District, says, "The bridge is a symbol of hard work, determination, and most of all, the power of grit to create a better future."
